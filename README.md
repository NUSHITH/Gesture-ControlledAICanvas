<p align="center">This project is a Streamlit-based application that integrates computer vision with AI to create an interactive interface controlled by hand gestures. The application captures real-time video from a webcam, detects specific hand gestures, and uses these gestures to either draw on a virtual canvas or trigger AI to solve problems displayed on the canvas. The AI then provides detailed answers based on the captured image.

ðŸ“ŒKey Features:

Hand Gesture Recognition: Detects hand gestures in real-time using OpenCV and the cvzone library.
AI Integration: Utilizes Google's Generative AI to interpret and solve problems depicted on the virtual canvas.
Virtual Drawing Canvas: Allows users to draw on the screen using their fingers, creating an interactive experience.
Streamlit Interface: A simple and user-friendly interface to display the captured video and AI-generated answers.

ðŸ“ŒLibraries Used : 
 
1.OpenCV (cv2): Used for capturing video from the webcam, processing images, and drawing on the virtual canvas.
2.NumPy (np): Used for handling arrays and matrices, particularly for image data manipulation.
3.Streamlit (st): Provides a simple web interface to display the video feed and AI results.
4.Pillow (PIL): Used for image manipulation, particularly converting OpenCV images to a format compatible with AI.
5.Google Generative AI (google.generativeai): Configured to generate responses based on the content of the virtual canvas.
6.CVZone (cvzone): A high-level library built on top of OpenCV for easy hand gesture recognition.
